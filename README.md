In this task, i am  performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a student dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly and started by generating summary statistics to understand the central tendency and spread of the data, and identified missing values. Then, i am  created histograms and boxplots to visualize the distribution and detect potential outliers in numeric features such as Age, Marks, and Attendance. A correlation matrix and pairplot were used to explore relationships between features.hese visualizations and insights help in understanding patterns, trends in the dataset
